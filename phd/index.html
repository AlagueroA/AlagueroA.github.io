<p>Context</p>

When stars form, material accumulates in a disc in their surroundings. The fraction of dust contained in that material eventually grow into planets over hundreds of thausends of years, making the disc called 'protolpanetary'. One can easily imagine that how this growth occurs depends on the properties of the protoplanetary disc : for example, more massive disc are thought to form massive planets. But this growing phenomenon also depends on the disc dynamics, ie on how the disc moves : for instance, a 'turbulent' disc will result in high-velocity collisions between dust particles, preventing their growth. Then, understanding protoplanetary disc dynamics is then a key step to understand how planets form.


It is now commonly accepted that stars are born multiples, namely in pairs of two, three, four, or even more. And if the planet formation process seems well understood for stars in isolation, everything becomes complicated when it comes to multiple stellar systems. As a first consequence, you can now have a protoplanetary disc around any star or group of stars of the system. A disc around one star, and another around two stars ? No problem, you can combine the configurations to make it more fun. As a second consequence, in multiple stellar systems several kinematic effects resulting from the star-disc gravitational intractions are expected to modify the disc(s) dynamics. It produces substructures inside the disc(s) and modifies the local planet formation conditions as a result.


<p>Aims</p>
How is the planet formation process shaped by stellar multiplicity ? What are the planet formation sites in multiple stellar systems ? What are the dust properties in multiple stellar systems ?

My first goal is to characterize discs in typical multiple systems both observationnally and numerically to assess their dynamical response to multiplicity. Comparing actual observations to numerical simulations (Hydrodynamical+Radiative Transfer), I aim to understand to what extent multiplicity shapes disc morphology and dynamics in young stellar systems.

Once the dust dynamics properly understood, the second step is to understand to what extent these dynamics impact the dust growth. In order to do so, I will use a combination of hydrodynamical simulations and dust growth algorithm, processed with a radiative transfer code. In this way, I will highlight the regions where dust particles either fragmentate or agglomerate, and thus the favored regions for planets to form in multiple systems.

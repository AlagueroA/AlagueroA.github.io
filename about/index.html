    <h2>Professional Skills</h2>
    
    <p>
        Teamwork<br>
        I use to work as a member of the ERC project Stellar-MADE, which forces me to communicate a lot with the other members and collaborators of the project to optimize the results.<br>
        
        Outreach<br>
        I like talking of what I like, so it is natural for me to (try to) explain astrophysics in a simplified way. I have taken part to outreach events, at the lab or elsewhere, and particularly like getting involved in them.<br>
        
        Organization of events<br>
        Laboratories should be animated places and I can't help bringing some life to them. My way to do it is to help in the organization of events at the laboratory or team level. For example, I am the captain of the lab football team but I am also conducting our science team meetings, making me a priviledged contact.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Personal Skills</h2>
    
    <p>
        Ambitious<br>
        From a young age, I have been captivated by the mysteries of space. The desire to study them emerged early on, evolving into a dream that has guided my academic journey. Aware of the intense competition, I have consistently sought out the most favorable conditions to realize this aspiration. While my efforts have yielded promising results, the journey is still ongoing. With a pragmatic approach and a forward-looking mindset, I am committed to making meaningful contributions to science, all while pursuing a passion that deeply inspires me.<br>
        
        Open-minded<br>
        I believe I have a lot to learn from the others, which is why I always welcome advice, feedback, and constructive criticism as essential tools for refining my work and adapt to the evolving landscape of astrophysics. Beyond my own development, I am passionate about fostering a culture of inclusivity and social justice within the academic community. In this context, I prioritize active listening and have earned a reputation as a trustworthy and reliable colleague and friend.<br>
        
        Versatile<br>
        People like to say I can easily blend in any social group. I don't know how true this is, but I know that I can adapt quickly to new working conditions. Could it be new softwares, new collaborations, or a new workplace, I am at ease with novelty. Through time, I constituted myself a arsenal of softwares/techniques that helps me to cover a large variety of topics in the planet formation field.
